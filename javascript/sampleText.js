  summary:
  `I am a web developer and coding instructor currently living in San Francisco.

  After graduating from UC Berkeley in 2014 and spending a year working on community health projects in Mendocino County, I attended App Academy's competitive 12-week programming bootcamp for training in web development. App Academy hired me as a full-time teaching assistant directly out of the program and I have been mentoring students, delivering lectures, developing internal tools, and creating curriculum since.

  My skillset includes Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, Flux, Redux, RSPec, Capybara, Jasmine, and Jest. I've been trained in object-oriented design patterns, Test Driven Development, and responsive design. I am well-practiced in working with new code bases and enjoy writing tests for React and Rails applications.

  I would love to work with your community organization or local business to create a beautiful web application.`,
